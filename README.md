# Udemy-lessons
This code is from the videos from udemy courses that I am using in order to help me learn more about web development. Udemy is an online learning and teaching marketplace with over 65000 courses and 15 million students. These courses range from a variety of teachings, since the program I am currently studying in university doesnt really cover much web development I am using this as a resource to help me better learn. the courses I am currently taking can be found in the following links.
